This client app written in Python3 demonstrates how Viper REAT API can be used for submitting verification tasks to the ViperServer and receiving the resulting stream of Json objects. 

### What is this repository for? ###

We used to use Nailgun for launching a persistent JVM for Viper. With ViperServer, we don't need Nailgun anymore. 

Use cases (list not exhaustive): 

* Collecting statistics 
* Black box testing of ViperServer

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install python3
* install pip for python3
* Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Run ```chmod +x client.py```

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Requests are welcome! Please send them to Arshavir: ter-gabrielyan@inf.ethz.ch
